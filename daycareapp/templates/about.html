            </h1>

            <p>
                Located in the larger Sun City metropolis, Angels Daycare is a private, for profit organization 
                founded in 1999. Our purpose is to provide children enrolled at the facility with an atmosphere 
                of warmth and care. We give each child individual attention while teaching them social awareness 
                and kindness towards others. Everyday, we aim to give each parent peace of mind knowing that 
                their child is in the care of mindful caregivers trained and certified to give the child a home 
                away from home.

                    OUR STORY
                </h3>
    
                <p>
                    Widowed at a young age, our founder and director, Dr. Mark Antony, knows from firsthand
                    experience the struggle single parents go thorugh to take care of their children while meeting 
                    their obligations at work. He started the daycare to cater to the needs of single fathers who just 
                    like him found themselves as the primary parent for their children for one reason or the other. 
                    
                    With time, the facility also became a hit with single mothers who were going through the same problem,
                    eventually transforming into the facility of choice even for children under the care of both parents.
    
                    To date, the daycare has taken care of 10,000+ children some of whom have grown up and also used the 
                    facility for their own children.
